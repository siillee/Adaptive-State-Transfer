# Adaptive State Transfer

Adaptive State Transfer (AST) represents a novel approach to state transfer protocols. By taking into account information from other replicas in the system, and using Linux Traffic Control (tc), a faster state transfer is possible. 

This is my Master's thesis project from EPFL. The code for AST can be found in the new_algorithm directory inside the main java directory. The thesis can be found in the top directory, file named Thesis_Report_Andrej_Milicevic.pdf.
